##### What is sever side validation

In the server-side validation, information is being sent to the server and validated using one of server-side languages. If the validation fails, the response is then sent back to the client

#### Why it is useful

This method is secure because it will work even if JavaScript is turned off in the browser and it canâ€™t be easily bypassed by malicious users.

#### Joi Tool

Joi allows you to create schemas for JavaScript objects (an object that stores information) to ensure validation of key information.

Check [Joi V17.3.0 API](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.3.0)

Here is an example for login fields using `joi` validation.

```js
const Joi = require('joi');

const schema = Joi.object({
  username: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).max(30).required(),
  password: Joi.string().min(7).required(),
});

// Return result.
const result = schema.validate(
  { username: 'abc', password: 'sh1121993$$MO' }
);
// result.error === null -> valid
```

- The server and the front-end have been set up for you, you can have a look to understand the flow, then follow up the exercise instructions bellow

### Exercise

- Clone the repository.
- Go to the terminal and run `npm i`
- run `npm run dev`
- Open `localhost:3000` in your browser
- Click on login button and make validation for all the variables. The variables are:
  - email -> should be an email
  - password -> should has at least 6 letters and contains [aA0-9]
- Click on sign-up button and make validation for all the variables. The variables are:
  - username -> should be string
  - email -> should be an email
  - password -> should has at least 6 letters and contains [aA0-9]
  - confirmPassword -> The same password value
  - role -> should be admin or user
  - mobile -> should be a number and at least has 7 numbers

_Note: All variables are required_
